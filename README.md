V1 was built with the h87c in mind and the V2 was built and tested with the Galatea PCB

You can find the H87/88C [here](https://hineybush.com/) or alternatively get a Galatea PCB [here](https://www.apexkeyboards.ca/) (for Canadians) and [here](https://studiokestra.ca/galatea/).

V1 uses Jane V2 plates
V2 uses Jane V2 CE plates

There's only one prototype of this board, there are some issues that I know of, definitely should look into them before making one of these boards on your own.
